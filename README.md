# Supervised autoencoder automation framework (SAEAF)

## Framework Purpose
The purpose of SAEAF is to automate the machine learning pipeline process, specifically for supervised autoencoders. 
It focuses on automating key tasks, such as data preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter optimisation, model building, training, and testing. 
By outlining a systematic approach to automating these steps, the framework is designed to streamline the workflow, reduce human intervention, and improve the efficiency and accuracy of the entire process.
